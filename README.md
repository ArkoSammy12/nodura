# NoDura

This is a small Fabric server-side mod that allows players to configure whether items in their inventories, such as armor and tools, should be damaged when used.

## Usage

Use the command `/nodura doDurability [true|false]` to toggle the durability damage mechanic for yourself. You can also just do `/nodura doDurability` to check the status of the toggle.
