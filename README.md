# NoDura

This is a small Fabric server-side mod that allows players to configure whether items in their inventories, such as armor and tools, should be damaged when used.

## Usage

Use the command `/nodura doDurability [true|false]` to toggle the durability damage mechanic for yourself. You can also just do `/nodura doDurability` to check the status of the toggle.

## Default NoDura mode

As a server admin, you can also select the default NoDura mode for new players by running
`/gamerule defaultNoDuraMode <noDuraMode>`

Where `<noDuraMode>` can be one of the following:

- `DoDurability`
- `NoDurability`
